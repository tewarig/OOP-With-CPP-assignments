// Inheritance supports the concept of code reusability in the program 
// If we want to create a Class new class, but suppose there is already a class which does the same work then we can Inherit the same class and it saves us a lot of time and promotes code reusability of the code. 

// For example here Dog class will be Inherited what to do from pets... And we donâ€™t have to write it again .. this will save our time and promote code reusability. 

#include<iostream>
